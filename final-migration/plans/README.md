# Versioned CUDA tactic plans

This directory contains compact production plans that are useful as runtime
and regression assets. The CUDA product name is the registry's unique primary
key, with exactly one current production plan per product. `target.gpu_class`
only selects an implementation space. Replacing a model's plan updates that
one entry; superseded
plans remain available through Git history rather than as parallel runtime
choices. A plan is admitted only when it is
`production_ready=true`, has complete positive-history closure, passed its
long whole-graph gate, and passed an immutable full-FP32 correctness gate.

Plans are hardware-, model-, precision-, board-, batch-, and stream-specific.
They are not universal defaults. After product-name lookup, the runtime
validates the complete receiver contract and fails closed on a mismatch. The
CUDA device ordinal recorded at scan time is provenance only and is not
applied on the receiver.

Production plans contain no scan-host absolute paths. Full commands and
environment snapshots stay in content-addressed scan records; plans retain
only portable identifiers, hashes, measurement/correctness summaries, and the
runtime apply mapping.

Current assets:

- `sm86/rtx3080ti-b8-s4/best-tactic-plan.json`: certified RTX 3080 Ti,
  exact B8, four streams per device, `1504.050501` long-gate physical
  nnEval/s. Its explicit runtime contract keeps CUDA Graph and batch-aware
  dispatch disabled, matching the configuration used for certification.
- `sm89/rtx4090d-b12-s2/best-tactic-plan.json`: certified RTX 4090 D, exact
  B12, two streams per device, `3110.7` long-gate physical nnEval/s.
- `sm120/rtx5080-b16-s2/best-tactic-plan.json`: certified RTX 5080, exact B16,
  two streams per device, `2836.2` long-gate physical nnEval/s.
