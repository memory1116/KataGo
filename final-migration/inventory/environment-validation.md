# Phase 1 validation

Validated on 2026-08-07 in the isolated final-migration workspace. No GPU
kernel was launched by these checks; the active optimization worktrees were not
modified.

This section records the superseded first environment build. It built Triton
because that package was present in the captured historical Python environment;
the maintained setup no longer treats it as a source component. No accepted
KataGo tactic was generated with Triton.

## Source builds

The source-capable Python components produced the following distributable
wheels. CUTLASS DSL is the documented upstream-binary exception because its
compiled MLIR payload is not source-published in the CUTLASS repository.

| Component | Version | Source commit | Wheel SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CUTLASS DSL | 4.7.0 | `dcf215af68a2d08d305076c152a06f201728cd53` | upstream binary |
| Compatible TVM-FFI | 0.1.12 | `3050b0a7bd48e04f853027c5fa1f5ab7bc20b856` | `94401b0488761d06be3891efd4d84c63f1c1d9093c0038d22b9c58b0b6a1d6df` |
| Triton | 3.8.0+git5bcfc513 | `5bcfc513ddbbc64f2688dfb15a4d824c56a9649a` | `57efe48b2efcc7ba3c1e4c29447afc91de012f946906ce5c6531f4bdc103f685` |
| Quack | 0.6.3 | `050387bde3d3f03a26c87279bff2df3173640127` | `63412dd22959bc2d6a66297868f044e0da9a4c755c051a3b1643c1b5a3e89e9e` |
| FlashAttention CuTe | 0.0.1.dev1+g69e1bcbe7 | `69e1bcbe77c359c84b3a4589e92a7c076e33a202` | `6ba3976f77e2e67bd6f85ca2b68f7f1b85261908e79e986eb419997ddde9213a` |
| TileLang | 0.1.13+cuda.git12dbf3e9 | `12dbf3e9d30d84b5c27d7b8b672c268457f7eb27` | `9152b9eae45c77d59cb8d5f42517954357638a6e9dae1e2b7958c18dc854ba30` |

The import audit passed for CUTLASS, TVM-FFI, Triton, Quack, FlashAttention
CuTe, and TileLang. Triton and TileLang both compiled no-run kernels for SM89
and SM120. CUDA/cuBLAS/cuDNN link checks, CUTLASS/CuTe header checks, and the
current cuDNN frontend header check also passed for the relevant targets.

An independently built TVM-FFI HEAD (`620fece9`) was rejected after it caused
`import tilelang` to fail at `tl.SwizzleMode`. Stable tag `v0.1.12` is the
highest version satisfying both the current TileLang and FlashAttention
constraints; both imports pass and `pip check` reports no FFI conflict with it.

## KataGo and distribution

Official KataGo `v1.17.2` commit
`6a1fc5de9fc253723ac475a0683bf0b9d9b7bd19` compiled successfully with only the
CUDA backend, CUDA 13.2.86, distributed build disabled, and TCMalloc disabled.
TensorRT, OpenCL, and Eigen were not built.

The current migration build resolves CUDA/cuDNN through the fixed PyPI wheel
tree and Ubuntu base-library directories. A first historical build
accidentally found Nsight Systems' private zlib; the build script now pins
`/usr/lib/<multiarch>/libz.so`. Packaging accepts the private venv's NVIDIA
wheel paths but rejects unrelated `/opt/nvidia` or `/workspace` runtime
resolutions.

The release form is a plain, non-invasive tar: the KataGo executable, locally
built source wheels, the exact binary wheel closure, a private ELF loader and
user-space CUDA/cuDNN/C++ runtime, manifests, licenses, installer, and
`SHA256SUMS`. It writes only an explicitly supplied empty prefix and never runs
APT on a target. The concrete file count, size, checksum, local empty-prefix
test, and Ubuntu 22.04 remote test are regenerated when the final tar is cut;
the current artifact is recorded outside Git at
`.final-migration-env/state/latest-distribution`.

## Non-invasive tar qualification

Artifact cut from commit `0c9d6237658f6ffd20de92645d3ef60bc799c357`:

- tar: `.final-migration-env/distributions/20260807T205459Z.tar`;
- size: 4,942,848,000 bytes;
- SHA-256: `7720e91da425e839d62b3ac560fd01b4656c8b4f374399584de6f6cb382b4801`;
- extracted payload: 127 regular files, 4,942,719,639 bytes, including 28
  recorded native runtime libraries.

Local qualification extracted it into a new empty prefix, verified both
external artifact hashes and all internal hashes/symlinks, resolved CUDA 13,
cuDNN 9, C++ and glibc through the private loader, ran `katago version`, then
restored/imported the complete cp312 wheel archive without network access.
The dpkg package-list hash was identical before and after deployment.

Remote qualification used `wangyize@10.101.3.156`, Ubuntu 22.04 amd64, glibc
2.35, an RTX 5080 and NVIDIA driver 595.84. The build-host executable requires
newer glibc symbols, so this specifically exercised the bundled glibc 2.39
loader rather than the host loader. Installation completed below only:

`/data/wangyize/katago-tar-validation-20260807T205459Z/runtime`

`katago version` passed from an unrelated working directory. The target dpkg
hash remained
`21cb9dcace4b9f02271626ef218c17bb183c6e86f432f1603f1771ad63e9d991`
before and after. The optional Python installer correctly rejected the host's
cp310 ABI before creating an environment; the standalone CUDA backend remained
usable. No APT command, sudo elevation, or system-directory write occurred.
